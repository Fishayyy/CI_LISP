Int and Double Casting - What happens when you cast a double as an int for litterals?
Reassignment of variables in the same scope
Type casting to symbols that aren't in the let section
How to handle missing symbol definitions - Is it 0, NaN or do we error and exit?
yyerror does not print. Should I make a seperate error function for printing errors?
Does rand() return 0 and does that matter?
